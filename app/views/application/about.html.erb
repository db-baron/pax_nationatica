     <h4>A list of times in political history when every nation of people that ever existed was at
       the height of its power. A decription of how that nation rose to the extent that it did, how
       things eventually fell apart, and finally the legacy that if left behind.

     <h3 class="main">What You <i>Won't</i> Find Here</h3>
     <h4>Empires whose existence were entirely dependent on the survival on one person
       (thatâ€™s another site). Discussions over whether the founders of the Kingdom X were truly members
       of Nation Y. Racism or other offensive comments. Empires or countries in which genocide was a
       major aspect of their being. I await your angry emails.</h4>
